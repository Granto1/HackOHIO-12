Victors’ Immune Response is an educational VR game designed with C#, Unity, and Blender for educating the public on what a white blood cell is and inspiring the younger generation to pursue STEM. In today’s classroom, many schools offer mundane and outdated textbooks to teach students about biology. Meanwhile, Victors’ Immune Response offers a fun, dynamic, and educational alternative, making learning biology easier and more engaging. For example, according to Texas A&M education research, video games can help students engage more and stay in STEM.  

Furthermore, we realized that most current educational games are boring and presented in 2D, which offers mundane gameplay. Meanwhile, our game, designed in VR, presents an ideal replacement for the old classroom approach and monotonous 2D educational games. The game represents a forward-thinking approach to STEM education. By making science learning interactive and fun, we hope to inspire the next generation of biologists, doctors, and scientists, preparing them for a future where their contributions can make a significant impact on the world.

The team used multiple online resources to create a realistic white blood cell environment and behaviors, such as the National Institute of Health’s website and Wikipedia. Furthermore, we consulted with biology students from Wayne State University. Using these resources, we identified the pros and cons of exploring each human body part, pathogens, and white blood cell functions. For example, we spent a lot of time creating accurate pathogen 3D models and the environments they are spawned in, which the biology students reviewed multiple times. 

During the hackathon, our team encountered technical roadblocks. Even though Unity offers a beginner-friendly approach, most of the team members had to pick up Unity from scratch with limited experience in other game engines. The technical roadblocks included the implementation of the interactions between the player and the game objects. To battle the learning curve, the team utilized the Unity documentation, forum posts, and online tutorials throughout the hackathon and implemented many functions.

Another issue we solved were version control and team collaboration. Work was split across multiple computers to maximize efficiency and due to Unity’s inefficiency in version control. Two team members worked on interactions between objects and players, continually updating a shared project on one of the members’ computer. A third team member worked on 3D modeling, constructing what was asked to be constructed throughout the hackathon. Lastly, a fourth member supplemented the implementation of whatever needed to be done on both ends. Our team encountered many failures. For example, we tried to implement the player interface like a traditional on-screen video game, but we realized that this strategy would not work in VR. So, we implemented an info viewer system, which displays the player information on the left controller, similar to a watch.  

Victor’s Immune Response is an immersive VR education game built in C#, Unity, and Blender for teaching and inspiring future biologists.
